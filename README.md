# BrainGame
Illustrate the connection between the nodes in a graph theory and find the shortest path using multiple type of search(Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Greedy First Search, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm).
<br><br>
To run with GUI, use GUIwindow.java  
To run without GUI, use Test_graph.java  
Sample input can get from Test.txt
<br><br>
When using GUI:  
press A to randomize node location  
press S to show markers of from(green node) and  to(red node) and cycle through them  
press D to remove markers  
after pressing S:  
press 1 --> Depth First Search  
press 2 --> Breadth First Search  
press 3 --> Greedy First Search (distance)  
press 4 --> Greedy First Search (time)  
press 5 --> Dijkstra's Shortest Path(distance)  
press 6 --> Dijkstra's Shortest Path(time)
